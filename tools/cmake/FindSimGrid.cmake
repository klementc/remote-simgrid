# Try to find the SimGrid library. 
#
# The user can hint a path using the SimGrid_PATH option.
#
# Once done, the following will be defined:
#  
#  SimGrid_INCLUDE_DIRS - the SimGrid include directories
#  SimGrid_LIBRARIES - link these to use SimGrid
#
# This could be improved in many ways (patches welcome):
#  - Not finding SimGrid is fatal. But who would want to 
#    overcome such a desperate situation anyway? ;)
#  - No way to specify a minimal version
#  - No proper find_package() integration
